### Added

- Quick Settings tile (Android 7+) for instant Sleep Mode ON/OFF (hard manual override).
- Persistent notification while Sleep Mode is active, including an “Stop now” action.
- Notification channel support (Android 8+) to ensure notifications display reliably.

### Changed

- Sleep Mode is now a full “bundle” action, not only Airplane Mode:

  - Airplane mode ON.
  - Wi‑Fi OFF.
  - Bluetooth OFF.
  - Force Doze/Idle mode on entry.
  
- Sleep Mode exit now always:
  - Unforces Doze/Idle.
  - Restores the pre-sleep snapshot (Airplane/Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth) regardless of any manual changes during sleep.
